#### Business Model & Motivation

Putting together a perfecly ordered playlist is no easy feat. In fact, creating such an optimal playlist is nearly impossible for a human, particularly when playlists consist of a multitude songs. This projects aims to use cognitive computing in order to make this possible.

DJ WATSON is a paid service and/or feature of a preexisting paid service (such as Spotify) in which users pay either a one time or recurring fee to use DJ Watson’s services. DJ Watson can make paid appearances at events, ranging from small gatherings such as private weddings, to the world’s largest festivals like Coachella. This will not only allow DJ WATSON to earn money from events/shows, but also allows more people to know about the product.

#### Points of Improvement and Further Work

There are several points of improvement for DJ WATSON. Firstly, we can personalize the model to the user by taking into account user feedback to retrain the model. Secondly, focusing the algorithm to weigh more heavily on the start and end of songs to make transitions more smooth and natural. Thirdly, incorporating an automatic linkage to Spotify so that the user can play directly from the browser. Lastly, we could improve the model further maybe try different Machine Learning APIs.
