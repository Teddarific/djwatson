#### Business Model & Motivation 

Putting together a perfecly ordered playlist is no easy feat. In fact, creating such an optimal playlist is nearly impossible for a human, particularly when playlists consist of a multitude songs. This projects aims to use cognitive computing in order to make this possible. 

DJ WATSON is a paid service and/or feature of a preexisting paid service (such as Spotify) in which users pay either a one time or recurring fee to use DJ Watson’s services. DJ Watson can make paid appearances at events, ranging from small gatherings such as private weddings, to the world’s largest festivals like Coachella. This will not only allow DJ WATSON to earn money from events/shows, but also allows more people to know about the product.
